### About

The goal was to combine old and new technology. In this case, to demonstrate
that an iPod Touch could record and playback audio from a reel-to-reel machine.

### Result

The video below includes the audio recording dubbed in. The music was Art
Kassel's band, recorded off the air sometime in the late 1940s. Enjoy!

### Materials

* [iPod Touch](http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/)
* [Square Reader](http://squareup.com/)
* RCA Model SRT-403 Tape Recorder
* [Paper Recording Tape](http://www.otrannex.com/papertapes/)

### Modifications

The recording head in the Square reader is pressed too tightly against the
opposing side of the device for tape to run through. This can be fixed by
opening the reader and weakening the piece of metal holding the head in place.

Pressing down on the points indicated by the red circles above was enough to
loosen the head.

### App

Any basic recording app would do. But for this project a simple app was built
to reflect the style and can be found at
